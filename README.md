# üó∫Ô∏è Spatial Mapping System

An advanced spatial mapping system developed using a Simple Link MSP-EXP432E401Y microcontroller, a Time-of-Flight (ToF) distance sensor, and a stepper motor. This system is designed to capture and visualize 3D environments in real-time, making it ideal for applications in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous navigation.

## üß≠ Overview

The Spatial Mapping System utilizes a ToF sensor mounted on a stepper motor to perform 360¬∞ scans of the environment. The system captures distance measurements at precise intervals, which are then processed and visualized on a connected PC using Open3D software. The data is transmitted from the microcontroller to the PC via UART communication, where it is rendered into a 3D point cloud.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time 3D Mapping:** Captures spatial data in real-time, enabling immediate 3D visualization.
- **Rotational Scanning:** Uses a stepper motor to rotate the ToF sensor, capturing distance measurements at 45¬∞ intervals.
- **High Precision:** Employs advanced algorithms to calculate x, y, and z coordinates from ToF sensor data.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Renders 3D point clouds using Open3D, allowing for detailed inspection of the scanned environment.
- **User-Controlled Sampling:** Provides user control over data collection with an onboard button and stop button for manual operation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Simple Link MSP-EXP432E401Y:** 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4F based microcontroller.
- **VL53LIX Time-of-Flight Sensor:** Utilized for precise distance measurements.
- **MOT-28BYJ48 Stepper Motor:** Enables rotational scanning of the environment.
- **Open3D:** Used for rendering 3D visualizations of the collected data.
- **Python & UART:** Facilitates communication between the microcontroller and the PC for data transfer and processing.
